# Investigating Continual Learning Strategies in Nueral Networks

This [paper](https://github.com/christam96/Investigating-Continual-Learning-Strategies-in-Nueral-Networks/blob/main/LaTeX%20Report/report.pdf)
explores the role of continual learning strategies when neural networks 
are confronted with the learning tasks sequentially. Our investigation measures
forgetting with three factors in mind: the type of network architecture used, the
continual learning scenario defined and the continual learning strategy implemented.
This work is motivated by the theory of complementary learning systems put forward by 
McClelland et al. in 1998 [1], suggesting that that complementary learning systems are
an essential ingredient in order to achieve lifelong learning. These results show that 
complementary learning systems provide significant improvements for memory retrieval and 
consolidation in neural networks, and provide the groundwork for further investigation 
in to the stability-plasticity dilemma.
